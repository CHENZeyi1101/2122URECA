# Abstract
The model of Network Coloring Game (NCG) is used to simulate conflict resolving and consensus reaching procedures in social science. In this work, we adopted some Markov Chain Techniques into the investigation of NCG. Firstly, with no less than ∆ + 2 colors provided, we proposed and proved that the expected conflict resolving time is strictly O(log n) and the variance of it is O((log n)2), by introducing an absorbing Markov Chain into NCG, where n is the number of vertices and ∆ is the maximum degree of the network. Secondly, inspired by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, we developed algorithms to consider post-resolution adjustments among players and estimate optimal payoffs when a Borda rule is applied. Experimental results were also given as supporting evidence to illustrate the corresponding procedures.
